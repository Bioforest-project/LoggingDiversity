**Effects of logging disturbance on tropical forest diversity - a global assessment**

## Questions

-   What is the effect of logging intensity on biodiversity \[change\], and how does it change through time? \[tipping point?\]
-   How does this relationship vary depending on abiotic factors? 
-   What is the effect of logging intensity on biodiversity \[change\] of different cohorts (newcomers vs survivors, by size class), and how does it change through time?

## Hypotheses

-   A positive hump-shaped relationship between post-logging diversity and logging intensity
-   In some sites/ecosystems (Misiones, fertile sites, etc) there is an invasion of fast-growing species (lianas, bamboo, Marantaceae) that displaces the hump/threshold to lower disturbance levels
-   Species richness of survivors decreases with logging intensity
-   A (positive) hump-shaped relationship between the diversity of newcomers and logging intensity; the height of the hump increases with the diversity of the surrounding forest (and thus the seed bank)
-   A more diverse landscape will lead to a higher + delayed hump in the post-logging diversity - intensity relationship

## Data

-   Diversity metrics (+ composition) for all cohorts (newcomers, survivors, by size class) for each census
-   Logging intensity: % basal area or volume lost (see metadata table)
-   Landscape variables: forest cover, etc. 
-   Wherever available: liana infestation index, invasive species, etc. 
-   Abiotic factors: climate, soil, other disturbances (storms, fire, droughts)

## Analyses

-   Decompose the diversity into cohorts: alpha diversity of newcomers and survivors; compare them with the beta diversity ; the gamma diversity is the diversity of the whole community. 
-   Comparing different biodiversity (and composition) metrics and interpreting the difference in the responses. 
-   Control for the effect of biogeography. 
-   Group trees based on dbh quantiles \> alpha diversity and beta diversity of the groups
