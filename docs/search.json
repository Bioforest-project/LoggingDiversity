    "text": "Framework: Tree diversity declines initially in response to logging, but then increases through time to a maximum value, after which it then declines in late succession. Tree diversity also shows a non-linear response to increased intensity of logging (proportion of biomass or basal area damaged and/or removed)): lightly logged forests show a transient increase in tree diversity, but more intensively logged forests show a strong negative effect on diversity, which recovers through time to a maximum. Therefore a three-dimensional plot of diversity (z axis) against time and logging intensity/damage shows a peak in the centre of the 3D space. In very heavily logged forests, the recovery of tree diversity takes longer and the maximum of diversity at the mid-point succession may not be observed, indicative of a dampening of the response. Logging intensity moderates/dampens the change in tree diversity through time."

Many climate products exists with different spatial and temporal resolution and different data origins and reanalyses methods. If we are looking for mean climates I would advise to use bioclimatic variables from CHELSA 2 (https://chelsa-climate.org/).\n\nCHELSA V2.1.1: Climatologies at high resolution for the earth’s land surface areas\nCHELSA (Climatologies at high resolution for the earth’s land surface areas) is a very high resolution (30 arc sec, ~1km) global downscaled climate data set currently hosted by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL. It is built to provide free access to high resolution climate data for research and application, and is constantly updated and refined.\n\n\n\nCode\nrast(\"data/French-Guiana_chelsa2_monthly-means_1980-2005.nc\") %&gt;% \n  extract(sites) %&gt;% \n  gather() %&gt;% \n  filter(key != \"ID\") %&gt;% \n  separate(key, c(\"variable\", \"month\"), \"_month=\") %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = value) %&gt;% \n  mutate(month = as.numeric(month)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = month)) +\n  geom_col(aes(y = pr/20), fill = \"grey\", col = NA) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = tas, col = \"mean\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = tasmax, col = \"maximum\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = tasmin, col = \"minimum\")) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  xlab(\"\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12,\n                     labels = c(\"J\", \"F\", \"M\", \"A\", \"M\", \"J\", \"J\", \"A\", \"S\", \"O\", \"N\", \"D\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    name = \"Temperature (°C)\",\n    sec.axis = sec_axis(trans = ~.*20, name = \"Precipitation (mm)\")\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.title.y = element_text(color = \"black\"),\n    axis.title.y.right = element_text(color = \"grey\")\n  ) +\n  scale_color_discrete(\"\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of CHELSA 2 data for the Paracou research station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil\nIn case local data are available for soil they should be preferred. However we can take advantage of public reanalyses such as SoilGrids (https://soilgrids.org/).\n\n\nCode\ntibble(\n  site = c(\"Paracou\"),\n  silt = c(13.25),\n  clay = c(21.5),\n  sand = c(63.25)\n) %&gt;% knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nsite\nsilt\nclay\nsand\n\n\n\n\nParacou\n13.25\n21.5\n63.25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisturbances\nFor fires we could use remotely sensed products such as “MODIS ACTIVE FIRE AND BURNED AREA PRODUCTS”: https://modis-fire.umd.edu/. Regarding storms, drought, etc I have no clue yet and should explore them."
