        "## Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "-   What is the effect of logging intensity on biodiversity \\[change\\], and how does it change through time? \\[tipping point?\\]\n",
        "-   How does this relationship vary depending on abiotic factors? \n",
        "-   What is the effect of logging intensity on biodiversity \\[change\\] of different cohorts (newcomers vs survivors, by size class), and how does it change through time?\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hypotheses\n",
        "\n",
        "-   A positive hump-shaped relationship between post-logging diversity and logging intensity\n",
        "-   In some sites/ecosystems (Misiones, fertile sites, etc) there is an invasion of fast-growing species (lianas, bamboo, Marantaceae) that displaces the hump/threshold to lower disturbance levels\n",
        "-   Species richness of survivors decreases with logging intensity\n",
        "-   A (positive) hump-shaped relationship between the diversity of newcomers and logging intensity; the height of the hump increases with the diversity of the surrounding forest (and thus the seed bank)\n",
        "-   A more diverse landscape will lead to a higher + delayed hump in the post-logging diversity - intensity relationship\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Diversity metrics (+ composition) for all cohorts (newcomers, survivors, by size class) for each census\n",
        "-   Logging intensity: % basal area or volume lost (see metadata table)\n",
        "-   Landscape variables: forest cover, etc. \n",
        "-   Wherever available: liana infestation index, invasive species, etc. \n",
        "-   Abiotic factors: climate, soil, other disturbances (storms, fire, droughts)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Analyses\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Decompose the diversity into cohorts: alpha diversity of newcomers and survivors; compare them with the beta diversity ; the gamma diversity is the diversity of the whole community. \n",
        "-   Comparing different biodiversity (and composition) metrics and interpreting the difference in the responses. \n",
        "-   Control for the effect of biogeography. \n",
        "-   Group trees based on dbh quantiles \\> alpha diversity and beta diversity of the groups\n",
