# Phylogeny {.unnumbered}

We can take advantage of the backbone phylogeny of two recently published mega-trees [@smith2018; @zanne2013] using the V.PhyloMaker R package [@jin2019] to build a phylogeny of studied species in case we want to add phylogenetic contrasts in our analyses. For instance, here is a phylogeny I build to look at species growth patterns in Paracou [@schmitt2023]:

```{r data_phylo}
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of species growth potential across the phylogeny from slow growing species in dark blue to fast growing species in yellow (log-scale) is phylogenetically structured (Pagelâ€™s =0.78, p<0.001) with a significant positive autocorrelation to a phylogenetic partistic distance below 100 (Fig. S2), corresponding to the genus level (Tab. 1)."
