# Traits {.unnumbered}

Functional traits data could be gathered from:

-   Local site data (e.g. I already have some for French Guiana, Santar√©m, and Uppangala)
-   Published data
-   Public data store, e.g. TRY

For instance, here is a recent functional traits data gathering and imputation that I have done for Santarem and Paracou: <https://sylvainschmitt.github.io/troll_eval/12_species.html>.

```{r data_fun}
#| fig-cap: "Functional composition estimated by TROLL at the Paracou and Tapajos site expressed in terms of distribution per trait and site."
